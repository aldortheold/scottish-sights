            <h2 class="name" id="NewLanark">New Lanark</h2>
            <p>New Lanark is a picturesque village in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, with a rich history and a fascinating story spanning over two centuries. It has transformed from a small cotton mill village to a thriving tourist destination. Founded in 1785 by David Dale, it quickly grew and became one of the largest cotton mill centers in Scotland. However, in the mid-20th century, the industry declined, leaving many of the village's iconic buildings abandoned and derelict.</p>
            <p>In the late 1960s, a group of visionaries restored the village, including the famous social reformer Robert Owen. Today, visitors can explore the restored mills and several museums, including the New Lanark Museum. New Lanark's charm lies in its blend of industrial heritage and natural beauty, with stunning architecture and opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts. Its vibrant community spirit and cultural events make it a unique destination, and its commitment to sustainability is an inspiration to others.</p>
